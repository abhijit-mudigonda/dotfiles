# dotfiles
In the unlikely event of a water or ground landing, dotfiles are located in the repository to your left

Here are some of my dotfiles. I use antigen as a package manager for zsh, and have a few custom functions that I use 
to speed up common operations (printing to Athena, jumping to class folders, opening textbooks, extracting compressed files, etc.)

I use vundle to manage vim plugins. :PluginInstall is all it takes!

I've been meaning to step up vim-tmux navigator but for now I just have separate controls for each. 

On the Fedora terminal window itself, I have the solarized dark scheme and solarized pallette.
